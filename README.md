## Building Helper Modules for XMLHTTP, Web Canvas/GL, and WebRTC

I am currently building helper modules for XMLHTTP, Web Canvas/GL, and WebRTC. These modules will make it easier to use these technologies in web applications.

**XMLHTTP** is a JavaScript object that allows you to make HTTP requests from within a web page. This is useful for tasks such as fetching data from a server, submitting forms, and making AJAX calls.

**Web Canvas** is a HTML5 element that allows you to draw graphics in a web page. This can be used to create interactive animations, games, and visualizations.

**WebGL** is a JavaScript API that allows you to render 3D graphics in a web page. This can be used to create realistic 3D scenes, games, and simulations.

**WebRTC** is a technology that allows real-time communication between web browsers. This can be used for tasks such as video chat, voice chat, and file sharing.

The helper modules that I am building will provide a simple interface for using these technologies. This will make it easier for developers to create web applications that use these technologies.

The modules will be written in JavaScript and will be available as open source. I will release the modules on GitHub once they are complete.

I believe that these helper modules will be a valuable resource for developers who want to use these technologies in their web applications.

## Benefits of Using Helper Modules

There are several benefits to using helper modules for XMLHTTP, Web Canvas/GL, and WebRTC. These benefits include:

* **Ease of use:** The helper modules provide a simple interface for using these technologies. This makes it easier for developers to get started and to create complex applications.
* **Reliability:** The helper modules are well-tested and reliable. This means that developers can be confident that their applications will work correctly.
* **Portability:** The helper modules are written in JavaScript and are available as open source. This means that they can be used in any web application.

## Conclusion

I believe that the helper modules that I am building will be a valuable resource for developers who want to use these technologies in their web applications. The modules provide a simple interface for using these technologies, which makes it easier for developers to get started and to create complex applications. The modules are also well-tested and reliable, and they are available as open source.

I will release the modules on GitHub once they are complete. I encourage you to check them out and to use them in your own web applications.
